Statement:
You are given a binary string s representing the arrangement of exhibits in a museum, where:

s[i] = '0' denotes that the ith exhibit is a sculpture, and
s[i] = '1' denotes that the ith exhibit is a painting.

As a curator, you would like to select 3 exhibits for a special exhibition. However, to ensure variety, no two consecutive exhibits out of the selected ones can be of the same type.

For example, given s = "001101", we cannot select the 1st, 3rd, and 5th exhibits as that would form "011", which is not allowed due to having two consecutive exhibits of the same type.

Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is either '0' or '1'.

Input:
A string s that contains only 0's and 1's

Output:
Return the number of valid ways to select 3 Art Pieces.

Points:
20

Sample Input:
001101
Sample Output:
6

Explanation
The following sets of indices selected are valid: - [0,2,4] from "001101" forms "010" - [0,3,4] from "001101" forms "010" - [1,2,4] from "001101" forms "010" - [1,3,4] from "001101" forms "010" - [2,4,5] from "001101" forms "101" - [3,4,5] from "001101" forms "101" No other selection is valid. Thus, there are 6 total ways.
