Statement:
In a quaint countryside, a farmer tends to his farm, which is home to only chickens and cows. With the information provided of the total number of heads and legs of animals present on the farm, your task is to assist the farmer in determining the possible counts of cows and chickens.

Constraints:

0 ≤ Heads ≤ 1,000,000
0 ≤ Legs ≤ 1,000,000

Input:
Two space-separated integers "Heads" and "Legs" representing the count of heads and legs of the animals present on the farm, respectively.

Output:
Two space-separated integers, representing the number of chickens followed by the number of cows. If there is no feasible solution, output should be -1.

Score:
5

Sample Input:
150 400

Sample Output:
100 50

Explanation:
Number of heads : 150

Number of legs: 400

Then only possible distribution of Chickens and Cows:
