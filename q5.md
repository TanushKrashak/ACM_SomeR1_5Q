Your objective is to navigate through a rectangular maze (M\*N), reaching the center. However, the traps laid out before you permit only a spiral path inward.

You'll be provided with the dimensions of the maze, representing the number of rows (M) and columns (N), along with the layout of obstacles and pathways.

Your solution should provide a sequence of movements, guiding you from the maze's perimeter to its center in a spiral fashion.

You always start from the top left corner of the maze.

Task: Develop an algorithm to guide your way through the maze, moving in a spiral manner towards the center.

Input:
The input consists of:

The number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 100).
For each test case, the dimensions M and N of the matrix (1 <= M, N <= 100).
The elements of the matrix as M rows of N integers each.

Example:

1

3 3

1 2 3

4 5 6

7 8 9

Output:

Output:

Return a list containing the elements of each maze arranged in the order of traversal.

Example:

1 2 3 6 9 8 7 4 5

Score 20

Sample Input:
1
3 3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Sample Output:
1 2 3 6 9 8 7 4 5

Explanation:
Starting from the top-left corner (1), the traversal proceeds to the right until reaching the end of the first row (2 and 3). Then, it moves downward to the last element of the last column (6), followed by moving left to the last element of the last row (9). Finally, the traversal moves upward to the center elements (8 and 7) and completes at the center element (5).
